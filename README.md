# MiniRHex: An Open-source Walking Hexapod

MiniRHex is a miniature scale hexapod heavily based on the design of RHex. Notable features include a laser-cut frame and 3D printed legs for low cost construction and an intuitive software package that allows for highly-customizable control over the robotâ€™s behavior. MiniRHex was designed to be an educational and outreach tool to allow students to experiment with a fully functional walking robot at a much lower cost. The low price tag lets research groups maintain a fleet of machines, allowing each student more hands-on interaction with the hardware. Possible educational principles include gait design and optimization, leg design and control, and mobile robot sensor incorporation.

## Setup Instructions
Building a MiniRhex require access to a 3D printer and laser cutter. The links for off the shelf parts can be found below.

### Parts List
The Parts List and Links to order can be found in [Parts List](https://github.com/robomechanics/MiniRHex/blob/master/MiniRhexHardware.xlsx)

### Assembly Instructions

### Software
1. Install OpenCM IDE from http://www.robotis.us/opencmide/
2. Clone primary repository at https://github.com/robomechanics/MiniRHex.git

### Configure Servo ID's
Several variables will have to be configured for each leg before we can upload code from the primary repository. First, we need to match the ID of each dynamixel servo to the diagram shown below. ID's can be changed using the OpenCM board and Robotis Example scripts. In the openCM IDE, go to File>Examples>Dynamixel Easy>b_setID. This script will let you set the ID number for a single servo attached through the openCM board. Change the NEW_ID variable to the ID number you are wanting to set, attach a single servo to the board and upload the code. Repeat this process for each servo. 

Set the Servo IDs
In the openCM IDE, go to File>Examples>Dynamixel Easy>b_setID
Change the NEW_ID variable to the ID number according to the diagram below
Attach only the corresponding servo to the board (disconnect any other servos)
Upload the code
Repeat steps b-d for each servo
Set the motor zeros in leg_info.cpp
Clone support repository at https://github.com/nikolaif399/zero_finder.git
Manually rotate each leg to be as close to straight down as possible
Download zero_finder.ino to the OpenCM
Open the serial monitor in the IDE and copy the zeros (printing) to the zeros array in leg_info.cpp


### Setting Leg Zeros
Next we need to set the servo zeros of each dynamixel. Due to slighly mechanical differences and leg mounting imperfections, each leg's zero position may not naturally point straight down. To fix, Clone support repository at https://github.com/nikolaif399/zero_finder.git and run zero_finder.ino on the OpenCM. Manually rotate each leg to be as close to straight down as possible. Open the serial monitor in the IDE and copy the zeros (printing) to the zeros array in leg_info.cpp.

## Operating Instructions
1. Connect the MiniRHex to your computer via the Micro USB port
2. Open MiniRHex.ino in the OpenCM IDE, check that under "Tools",
3. "Board" is set to ROBOTIS OpenCM9.04
4. "Port" is set to the correct COM port (whichever COM port is added when MiniRhex is plugged in)
5. Ensure the motor zeros in leg_info.cpp are correct
6. Set desired gait parameters in gait_parameters.cpp
7. Click the download icon in the upper left corner of the OpenCM IDE (wait until it reports "Done Downloading")
8. Disconnect the Micro USB cable and connect the battery
9. Flip the power switch on the OpenCM board
10. Press the "RESET" button, make sure all motor LEDs are green
11. Press "USER SW" to execute the code!
12. Press the "RESET" button again to return to the standing behavior
