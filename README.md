# MiniRHex: An Open-source Walking Hexapod

![MiniRHex Prototype](Images/mini1.png)

MiniRHex is a miniature scale hexapod heavily based on the design of RHex. Notable features include a laser-cut frame and 3D printed legs for cheaper construction and an intuitive software package that allows for highly-customizable control over the robotâ€™s behavior. MiniRHex was designed to be an educational and outreach tool to allow students to experiment with a fully functional walking robot at a much lower cost. The low price tag lets research groups maintain a fleet of machines, allowing each student more hands-on interaction with the hardware. Possible educational principles include gait design and optimization, leg design and control, and mobile robot sensor incorporation.
